__pyy.js__ is a JavaScript library which is designed to facilitate the creation
of HTML elements in code without the need for either a templating language or
verbose method calls.

For more information, see [pyyjs.com][1]



Usage
-----

Coming soon...



Building
--------

The library is built using `make.py`, a custom script which performs all of the
build operations. You must have Python, Google Closure Linter, and Java
installed and accessible on your path.

Once built, the assembled library will be created in the `dist/` folder along
with a compressed version.
