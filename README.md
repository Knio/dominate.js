__pyy.js__ is a JavaScript library which is designed to facilitate the creation
of HTML elements in code without the need for either a templating language or
verbose method calls.



Usage
-----

Coming soon...



Building
--------

The library is built using `GNU Make`, a custom script which performs all of the
build operations. You must have [Python][2], [Google Closure Lint][3], and
[Java][4] installed and accessible on your path.

Once built, the assembled library will be created in `/pyy.js` and `pyy.min.js`
